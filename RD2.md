In lab 9, we were supposed to learn storing data in a list, processing a list, error checking, doing file I/O, using
loops, and following problem-solving techniques. Our procedure to solving this problem was to focus on what Dr. Zee 
showed us in class and on the board to make sure our code was perfect. We first began with figuring out the three types 
of functions we had to create, then writing our algorithm, and lastly coding. The key concepts explored were lists 
within functions, and storing and calling files into functions to produce an output. Our results did match what I
expected and the way it was coded was simpler than I thought it would be. Using various and extreme test cases we were 
able to verify and check to make sure our code worked in every case or accidental input. We followed the first three
rules of programming by making a game plan, creating a human-readable essay, and testing and practicing with our code.
We overcame the challenges of trying to figure out the three different functions by discussing with nearby groups also 
doing the lab and conversing until we understood what the problem was asking. A key takeaway I had from this lab was how
to use the try and except loop and file I/O. I think I did learn what I was supposed to from this lab because I learned 
more about lists, files, and functions. Working with Jos√© was great, we planned and communicated effectively to finish 
the lab.
