The objective of this lab was to practice essential programming concepts like using for loops, working with file input/output, storing data in lists, and processing lists to achieve a clear, structured output. By building a program to read names from a file and assign each student to a specific table and seat, we were able to implement these foundational skills practically. Additionally, the lab required us to handle invalid file names with input validation, providing a chance to incorporate try and except blocks to catch errors gracefully. This exercise also involved creating a visual element in the output, which made the data presentation more engaging and gave us a better understanding of formatting outputs for user-friendly results.

The process was straightforward, and my partner and I leveraged our class notes on lists and file handling to approach each part of the program. We used a try block within the file-reading function to ensure that if a file wasn’t found, a clear error message would prompt the user to try again. By testing different inputs, especially slight variations in file names, we confirmed that the program handled errors as expected. Overall, the output matched our expectations perfectly, displaying each student’s assigned seat and table in a neatly formatted manner. Working with my partner, who has a clear and concise approach to algorithms, made the experience enjoyable. This lab solidified our understanding of file handling and list processing while emphasizing the importance of clean, efficient code.
